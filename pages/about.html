      <p class="text-left">I grew up in the south Chicago suburbs as the middle child in a family consisting of my
        parents and my two brothers. I was always the "nerdy" one in any group of friends I hung 
        out with, often being more interested in books and science than everyone else. I remember
        "programming" pictures using Turtle Graphics on the family "computer", a Commodor VIC-20
        gaming system.
